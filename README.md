A super-simple browser-based app to sort, filter, and watch videos in a local folder. No installs, no fuss, plug and play. 

## Quick Start

2. Open index.html in your web browser of choice.
3. Find and open a folder with your media.
4. Everything will stay on your device. Have fun and let me know what you think.

This is still a very early version of this product and is made for fun and my own education. 
In other words: it's low-stakes and suggestions are welcome üòÅ
